# Multiple ML modeling for HLB prediction

Nontargeted metabolomics-based multiple machine learning modeling boosts early accurate detection for citrus Huanglongbing 

This repository includes four groups of features (metabolites) data acquired from different detection methods, and each group consists of a dataset of 12 healthy plants and 12 infected plants, along with the machine learning codes for classification.

The code was tested on Python v3.8.8

CN for C18 column–negative ion mode, CP for C18 column–positive ion mode, HN for HILIC column–negative ion mode, and HP for HILIC column–positive ion mode.

data_healthy.csv for healthy plants, and data_infected.csv for HLB-infected plants.

data_test for external test.
