# Multiple ML modeling for HLB prediction

Multiple machine learning modeling combined with UHPLC/MS-based untargeted metabolomics for early detection of citrus Huanglongbing (HLB) 

This repository includes four groups of data acquired from different detection methods, and each group consists of a dataset of 12 healthy plants and 12 infected plants, as well as the machine learning codes for classification.

The code was tested on Python v3.8.8

CN for C18 column–negative ion mode, CP for C18 column–positive ion mode, HN for HILIC column–negative ion mode, and HP for HILIC column–positive ion mode.

data_healthy.csv for healthy plants, and data_infected.csv for HLB-infected plants.
